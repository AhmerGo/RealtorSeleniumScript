Real Estate Scraper
This project consists of a Python script that automates the process of searching for real estate listings on realtor.com. It applies various search filters, navigates the results, and collects information about each listing.

Features
Automated search with custom keywords
Application of multiple search filters
Navigation through search results
Collection of details from individual property listings
Randomized wait times to simulate human interaction
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6 or above installed on your system
A virtual environment is recommended for the Python project (venv)
SeleniumBase package installed for easy WebDriver management
Installation
To install the required Python packages, run the following command in your virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install seleniumbase
You also need to download the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you want to automate. For Google Chrome, you would typically download chromedriver.

Usage
To run the script, navigate to the project directory and execute:

bash
Copy code
python Realtor.py
Make sure to activate your virtual environment before running the script.

Script Details
Below is a brief explanation of the main parts of the script:

Initialization: Set up the browser window and navigate to the target URL.
Search: Input the search term and perform the search operation.
Filter Application: Apply filters for more refined search results.
Data Extraction: Extract and print the agent overview for each property listing.
Please note: The script includes deliberate pauses using random_wait to prevent being detected as an automated bot and to mimic human-like interactions.
