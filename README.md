# Real Estate Scraper

Automate your real estate searches with ease using our Real Estate Scraper. This Python-based tool interacts with `realtor.com` to perform searches, apply filters, and extract listing information based on your customized needs.

## Features

- **Automated Searches**: Input your search parameters and let the script handle the rest.
- **Customizable Filters**: Apply a variety of filters to narrow down your results.
- **Data Extraction**: Automatically collect and display information from each listing.
- **Human-like Interaction**: Randomized wait times to mimic natural browsing behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) for package installation
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) (optional but recommended)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-scraper.git
cd real-estate-scraper
```

## The Realtor.py script does the following:

Opens a browser window and goes to realtor.com.
Searches for properties based on specified criteria.
Filters the results according to provided filters.
Collects the details from each property and prints them.
Note: The script includes random_wait function calls to prevent detection by anti-bot mechanisms and to emulate human-like pauses.
